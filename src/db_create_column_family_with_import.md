Creates a new column family by importing a collection of SST files. The external SST files can be created in one of the
following ways:

1. Directly using [`SstFileWriter`](crate::SstFileWriter).
2. Exported from a particular column family in an existing DB using [`Checkpoint::ExportColumnFamily`][export_cf]. In
   that case, `metadata` should be the output of [`ExportColumnFamily`][export_cf].

The parameter `import_options` can specify whether to copy or move the external files (default is to copy). If set to
copy, managing the source files is the caller's responsibility. When set to move, the operation will attempt to delete
the external files on successful import, logging any failure to delete rather than returning an error. Files are not
modified on any error, and a best effort is made to remove any newly-created files. A new Column Family will be present
on a successful return, and will not be present on error. A Column Family may be present if a crash occurs during a
call.

# Examples

```rust
use rust_rocksdb::{ExportImportFilesMetaData, ImportColumnFamilyOptions, Options, DB};

fn import_column_family(
    db: &mut DB,
    column_family_name: &str,
    import_metadata: &ExportImportFilesMetaData,
) {
    let cf_opts = Options::default();

    let mut import_opts = ImportColumnFamilyOptions::default();
    import_opts.set_move_files(true);

    db.create_column_family_with_import(
        &cf_opts,
        column_family_name,
        &import_opts,
        &import_metadata,
    )
        .unwrap();
}
```
